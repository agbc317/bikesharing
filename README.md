## Overview of the statistical analysis:
This analysis was performed to better understand the trends of Citi Bike riders in New York City.
## Results:

On the first page of the story we have two visualizations. THe first is a heatmap showing the trips by weekday per hour. This shows that the busiest times for riders are the hours between 6 and 9 am and 4 and 7 pm on weekdays, and the hours between 9 and 7 pm on the weekends. The second is a line graph showing the checkout times for users which shows that the majority of rides are between 0 and 30 minutes long. 

The second page of the story shows three visualizations.The first is a heatmap showing the trips by weekday per hour broken down by gender. Through this heatmap we can see that Male riders make up a larger number of riders than the female riders. The second is a line graph of checkout times broken down by gender which shows that the average ride time for female and male riders are very similar. The third visualization is a pie chart which shows the gender breakdown of riders which shows that male riders make up more than half of the population.

The third page of the story shows three visualizations. The first is a heatmap of user trips by gender by weekday. This shows that more trips are completed by subscribers than by customers meaning that many riders are repeats who ride multiple days a week. The other two visualizations on this page are maps showing start and end locations for rides. These maps show a similar pattern showing that most rides occur in manhattan and that most riders are riding to and from the same places.

## Summary:

All of this data suggests that the majority of riders are male subscribers who are using the bikes to ride to and from their jobs. 
I would suggest mapping both the usertypes start and end locations. This would show where subscribers are using bikes compared to single ride customers.
